# Lala
An expression oriented data notation, aimed at transpiling itself to any cascaded data notation.

## Quick Examples

Some examples will be provided here as an introduction to lala.

- lala4html
- lala4css
- lala4json
- lala4toml
- lala4yaml

Also some "just because I can" examples:
- lala as fp
- lala with oo

## Roadmap

### Nana

Nana, a proof-of-concept language, will first be implemented, along with the following key concepts:

1. Block
    - Obstruction
    - Projection
    - Exposure
2. Value Space
    - Literal
    - Application
3. Binder Space
    - Abstraction
    - Pattern Language
4. Control Flow 
    - Pattern Matching

### Lala

Nana++. 

1. the order of computation embedded in data structure
2. more data structures as primitives
3. type system
4. a standard library

### Dada

A (fake) package manager in pure lala, designed more as a structural convention than a heavy building system.


## Language Proposal
- Nana: [nana-lang proposal](nana/Proposal.md).
- Lala: [lala-lang proposal](lala/Proposal.md).
- Dada: tbd.

## Current Progress
Using [lalrpop](https://github.com/lalrpop/lalrpop) as nana/lala's parser to Rust.
